class - 4

    -- recap --
        -- cucumber options in runner class -
        dry run - to quickly get the step definitions

    --whenever we write new scenario in feature file, we must set dryrun to true
    for step definition and then put this definition under steps package, after
    writing the code in it, again set dryrun to false and execute the script


        monochrome - when we set it to true, it removes irrelevant information
        or unreadable character from console while executing cucumber test cases.

        Hooks -
        pre condition @Before
        post condition @After

        we must keep hooks class under steps package

        background - common steps in a feature file until flow is not broken

       it is applicable only to a feature file, every file can have a different background

       tags - to categorize our scenarios for execution

       What is data driven testing:
        when we execute our script against multiple sets of data we call it data
        driven testing
