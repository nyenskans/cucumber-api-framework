Class 3 -

-- recap --
                -- architecture of framework --
    1. utils - all the utilities of our project such as constants, config reader
        common methods can be found under this package  etc to reuse them.


    2. steps - all step definitions can be found under this package for the gherkin
       steps we used in feature file
    3. Pages -- POM -- we need it to implement object repository and functions.
       (We store all the WebElements- objects in it--> we use page factory to initialize them)

    4. Runner class - we use this class to execute all of our test cases


// When we only want to get the step definition for one specific step: we put comma next to glue and write: dryRun = true


For pre condition and post condition in cucumber we have 2 annotations

Hooks -
@Before - this one we use for pre condition
@After - this one we use for post condition

- Hooks should always be mentioned under steps package (separate class)


Background vs hooks

Hooks are applicable to all feature files
Background is applicable to just one feature file\

Hooks execute first then background executes then scenario executes and in the
end hooks executes again as post condition
